== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you do this? =

Because I needed a simple plugin to do this job and decided to do it on his own. Since the Quicktag API is build in this plugin is very lightweight.

= Why only those tags? =

After careful consideration those are the only ones they ever use! If you have a reasonable argument why I should add in others, I'll listen. Thus far, the only suggestion interesting was 'code' and I determined people won't use that unless they know about it, and thus are capable to entering it manually.

= Will you add in options to pick and chose our tags? =

No. I don't have a need for it, and I don't want to include code I'm not going to personally make use of. It makes it much harder on me to support it later. (Read <a href="http://www.sohar.com/proj_pub/download/COMPAS93.pdf">Herbert Hecht's article "Rare Conditions � An Important Cause of Failures"</a> to understand my views on including rarely used code. tl;dr: I try not to.)

= Does this work on Multisite? =

Yes. It can be network activated or per-site, works fine.

= Will you expand this to BuddyPress? =

Not at this time.
